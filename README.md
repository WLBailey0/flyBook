<h1>Fly Book CLI</h1>

<h3>History</h3>
<div><p>This Java project is for storing and retreiving information on flies for fly fishing and their recipies for tying it your self. I have been tying flies and fly fishing since 2002 and am now happy to 
combine my love for fly fishing with programing</p></div>

<h3>The Program</h3>
<div><p>
This program was made using java and postgresql. It impliments a cli class to accept user input. It utilizes the Data Access Object pattern to isolate the business layer from the persistence layer. A POJO class is used for the getters and setters while a DAO interface is used to keep the domain layer compleatly decoupled from the persistence layer.
